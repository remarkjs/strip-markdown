[**remark**][remark] plugin remove markdown formatting.
This essentially removes everything but paragraphs and text nodes.

> This is one of the first remark plugins, before prefixing with `remark-` got
> cool.

## Note!

This plugin is ready for the new parser in remark
([`remarkjs/remark#536`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/pull/536)).
No change is needed: it works exactly the same now as it did before!

## Install

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c):
Node 12+ is needed to use it and it must be `import`ed instead of `require`d.

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install strip-markdown
```

## Use

```js
import {remark} from 'remark'
import strip from 'strip-markdown'

remark()
  .use(strip)
  .process('Some *emphasis*, **importance**, and `code`.')
  .then((file) => {
    console.log(String(file))
  })
```

Yields:

```txt
Some emphasis, importance, and code.
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `stripMarkdown`.

### `unified().use(stripMarkdown[, options])`

## Security

Use of `strip-markdown` does not involve [**rehype**][rehype] ([**hast**][hast])

attacks.
