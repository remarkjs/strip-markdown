## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] ([remark][]) plugin to remove most nodes so as to
just leave text.

## When should I use this?

You can use this if you want to ignore the syntax of markdown.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install strip-markdown
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import stripMarkdown from 'https://esm.sh/strip-markdown@6'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import stripMarkdown from 'https://esm.sh/strip-markdown@6?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {remark} from 'remark'
import strip from 'strip-markdown'

const file = await remark()
  .use(strip)
  .process('Some *emphasis*, **importance**, and `code`.')

console.log(String(file))
```

Yields:

```txt
Some emphasis, importance, and code.
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is [`stripMarkdown`][api-strip-markdown].

### `unified().use(stripMarkdown[, options])`

Remove markdown formatting.

* remove `code`, `html`, `horizontalRule`, `table`, `toml`, `yaml`, and
  their content
* render everything else as simple paragraphs without formatting
* uses `alt` text for images

###### Parameters

* `option` ([`Options`][api-options], optional)
  — configuration

###### Returns

Transform ([`Transformer`][unified-transformer]).

### `Handler`

Transform a node (TypeScript type).

###### Parameters

* `node` ([`Node`][mdast-node])
  — node

###### Returns

Result (`Array<Node>` or `Node`).

### `Options`

Configuration (TypeScript type).

###### Fields

* `keep` (`Array<string>`, optional)
  — list of node types to leave unchanged
* `remove` (`Array<[string, Handler] | string>`, optional)
  — list of node types to remove (or replace, with handlers)

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports the additional types [`Handler`][api-handler] and
[`Options`][api-options].

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with maintained
versions of Node.js.

When we cut a new major release, we drop support for unmaintained versions of
Node.
This means we try to keep the current release line, `strip-markdown@6`,
compatible with Node.js 16.

## Security

Use of `strip-markdown` does not involve **[rehype][]** (**[hast][]**) or user
content so there are no openings for [cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss] attacks.
